# Sambin

A place to store (and easily install) all of my commonly used scripts.

### Usage


Install everything:
```shell
bash install.sh
```

Only install new scripts:
```shell
bash install.sh -n
```

Only install one script (prompts for user confirmation)
```shell
bash install.sh -o
```

Enjoy! ‚úåüèª
